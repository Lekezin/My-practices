<ul>
    <li>1 large egg, room temperature</li>
    <li>1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing the pan</li>
    <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups (170 g) tapioca flour</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (66 g) packed grated or crumbled cheese, your preference</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt (or more to taste)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly grease a 9-inch round cake pan or pie dish with olive oil.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg, olive oil, and milk until well combined.</li>
    <li>Add the tapioca flour, cheese, and salt to the wet ingredients. Stir until a sticky dough forms. The dough will be quite thick and elastic.</li>
    <li>Transfer the dough to the prepared pan. Use your hands or a spatula to spread it out evenly, pressing it into the edges of the pan.</li>
    <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the bread is cooked through. You can test for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center; it should come out clean.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven and let cool slightly before slicing and serving. Enjoy your gluten-free pão de queijo!</li>
